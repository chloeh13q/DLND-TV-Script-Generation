    "I initially used a dropout layer and passed all of my outputs through a sigmoid activation function. However, despite repeated testing with different parameters, my model always started out with a loss of ~9.3 and this value only decreased slightly in each printout. After consulting different sources, I decided to drop both the dropout layer (since this specific model is unlikely to overfit) and the sigmoid activation function (which is redundant when CrossEntropyLoss() is used as the loss function). I then saw much better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "I tested different values of the following parameters:\n",
    "- **Learning rate:** I started with a learning rate of 0.001, and later also tried learning rates of 0.01 and 0.005. Training loss seemed to decrease much more slowly when learning rate was set to 0.01.\n",
    "- **Number of layers:** I tested both 2 and 3 layers for the LSTM. Although training seemed to take considerably longer with 3 layers, I did not see a significant improvement in training loss. Therefore, I decided to stick to 2 layers in order to speed up the training process.\n",
    "- **Sequence length:** I looked at the data file and counted the number of words for each line. Although the number of words ranges from 1 to a couple hundred, I thought 8-20 would be a reasonable length for an average line. I tested 8, 10, and 15, and saw the best results with a sequence length of 15.\n",
    "- **Embedding dimension:** I started with an embedding dimension of 400 (which was taken from the previous Jupyter Notebook tutorial), but did not see the quick drop in training loss that I had expected. After doing some research on Google, I read that [parameters on the embedding layer and last layer actually have a larger impact on the model performance than the number of LSTM layers or recurrent units](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06799). This prompted me to try different values of embedding dimensions. \n",
    "- **Batch size:** Increasing batch size from 32 to 64 also seemed to train the model more quickly.\n",
    "- **Hidden dimension:** I tried values from 200 to 600 for hidden dimension. A hidden dimension of 512 gave a smaller initial training loss than a hidden dimension of 256."
